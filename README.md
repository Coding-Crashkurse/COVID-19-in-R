# COVID-19-in-R

This project contains an R Shiny App with a global map with covid 19 infections and deaths.
Is has two main goals:

1. Combine (merge) two datasets from different sources to provide additional insights.
2. Create a world map which provides an animated timeline with the integrated `motion.js` plugin.

This repository includes a Dockerfile to create a production build for this application.

Have fun :-)
